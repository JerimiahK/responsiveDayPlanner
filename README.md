# responsiveDayPlanner

## Description
This application was designed and engineered to help make employees lives easier and more stream lined by giving them a color coded work scheduler. The header automatically updates the current day and date and the time-blocks are color coded to be able to easily see time-blocks in the past, present, and future all using the DayJS API. Users can use the time blocks to input notes and reminders and use the save button on the right hand side to save their input to local storage where it will be saved and gotten upon refresh of the page.
